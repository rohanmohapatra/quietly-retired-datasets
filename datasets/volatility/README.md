## Why is it obsolete?

The Oxford-Man Realized Library was discontinued in 2022 due to lack of funding and support by the new director of the Institute. Underlying historical tick data data was purchased from Thomson Reuters / Refinitiv and RV code was created by Kevin Sheppard. There are currently no plans to reinstate the library.
