# Quietly Retired Datasets
A repository dedicated to preserving datasets from sources that have fallen silent, become obsolete, or faced funding challenges. In the ever-evolving landscape of data, valuable datasets sometimes get lost in the digital silence. This repository aims to provide a sanctuary for such datasets, ensuring they remain accessible for research, historical analysis, or potential revival.

### Goals and Objectives:
- Preservation: Safeguard datasets that might otherwise be lost due to discontinued sources or obsolete platforms.
- Accessibility: Make these datasets available to researchers, data enthusiasts, and the community at large, fostering continued exploration and analysis.
- Documentation: Include information on the origin, context, and any known issues with each dataset to aid users in understanding and utilizing the data effectively.

### Contribution Guidelines:

Contributions are welcome! If you have datasets from sources that fit the criteria, feel free to submit pull requests. Please ensure proper documentation accompanies each dataset, including its original source, context, and any relevant metadata.
